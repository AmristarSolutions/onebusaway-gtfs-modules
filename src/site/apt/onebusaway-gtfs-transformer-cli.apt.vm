Introduction

  The <<<onebusaway-gtfs-transformer-cli>>> command-line application is a simple command-line tool for transforming
{{{https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs}GTFS}} feeds. 

Getting the Application

  You can download the application here:

#set( $url = 'http://nexus.onebusaway.org/service/local/artifact/maven/content?r=public&g=org.onebusaway&a=onebusaway-gtfs-transformer-cli&v=' + ${currentVersion} )
  
  {{{${url}}onebusaway-gtfs-transformer-cli-${currentVersion}.jar}}
  
Using the Application

  You'll need a Java 1.6 runtime installed to run the client.  To run the application:

+---+
java -jar onebusaway-gtfs-transformer-cli.jar [-args] input_gtfs_path ... output_gtfs_path
+---+

  <<Note>>: Transforming large GTFS feeds is often processor and memory intensive.  You'll likely need to increase the
max amount of memory allocated to Java with an option like <<<-Xmx1G>>> (adjust the limit as needed).  I also recommend
adding the <<<-server>>> argument if you are running the Oracle or OpenJDK, as it can really increase performance. 

* Arguments

  * <<<--transform=...>>> : specify a transformation to apply to the input GTFS feed (see syntax described below)
  
  * <<<--agencyId=id>>> : specify a default agency id for the input GTFS feed
  
  * <<<--overwriteDuplicates>>> : specify that duplicate GTFS entities should overwrite each other when read
  
  []
  
* Transform Syntax

  Transforms are specified as snippets of example.  A simple example to remove a stop might look like:
  
+---+
{"op":"remove","match":{"file":"stops.txt","stop_name":"Stop NameP"}}
+---+

  You can pass those snippets to the application in a couple of ways.  The simplest is directly on the command line.

+---+
--transform='{...}'
+---+

  You can have multiple <<<--transform>>> arguments to specify multiple transformations.  However, if you have a LOT of
transformations that you wish to apply, it can be easier to put them in a file, with a JSON snippet per line.  Then
specify the file on the command-line:

+---+  
  --transform=path/to/local-file
+---+

  You can even specify a URL where the transformations will be read:
  
+---+  
--transform=http://server/path
+--+

Matching 

  We provide a number of configurable transformations out-of-the-box that can do simple operations like adding,
updating, retaining, and removing GTFS entities.  Many of the transforms accept a "`match`" term that controls how the
rule matches against entities:

+---+
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"574"}}
+---+

  Here, the match snippet at minimum requires a `file` property that specifies the type of GTFS entity to match.
Any file name defined in the {{{https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#FeedFiles}GTFS specification}}
can be used.

  You can specify additional properties and values to match against as needed.  Again, use the field names defined for
each file name in the GTFS specification.  For example, the snippet above will match any entry in `routes.txt` with a
`route_short_name` value of `574`.

* Compound Property Expressions

  Property matching also supports compound property expressions that allow you to match across GTFS relational
references.  Let's look at a simple example:

+---+
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"trips.txt", "route.route_short_name":"10"}}
+---+

  Here the special `routes` property references the route entry associated with each trip, allowing you to match
the properties of the route.  You can even chain references, like `route.agency` to match against the agency
associated  with the trip.  Here is the full list of supported compound property references:

+---+
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "agency.name":"Metro"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"trips.txt", "route.route_short_name":"10"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"stop_times.txt", "stop.stop_id":"153"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"stop_times.txt", "trip.route.route_type":3}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"frequencies.txt", "trip.service_id":"WEEKDAY"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"transfers.txt", "fromStop.stop_id":"173"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"transfers.txt", "toStop.stop_id":"173"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"fare_rules.txt", "fare.currencyType":"USD"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"fare_rules.txt", "route.route_short_name":"10"}}
+---+

* Multi-Value Matches

  The compound property expressions shown above are all for 1-to-1 relations, but matching also supports a limited
form of multi-value matching for 1-to-N relations.  Let's look at a simple example:

+---+
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "any(trips.trip_headsign)":"Downtown"}}
+---+

  Notice the addition of `any(...)` around the property name.  Here we are using a special `trips` property that
expands to include all trips associated with each route.  Now, if *any* trip belonging to the route has the specified
`trip_headsign` value, then the route matches.  Here is the full list of supported multi-value property matches:

+---+
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"agency.txt", "any(routes.X)":"Y"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "any(trips.X)":"Y"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"file":"trips.txt", "any(stop_times.X)":"Y"}}
+---+

* Collection-Like Entities

  There are a number of GTFS entites that are more effectively collections identified by a common key.  For example,
shape points in `shapes.txt` linked by a common `shape_id` value or `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt` entries
linked by a common `service_id` value.  You can use a special `collection `match clause to match against the entire
collection.

+---+
{"op":..., "match":{"collection":"shape", "shape_id":"XYZ"}}
{"op":..., "match":{"collection":"calendar", "service_id":"XYZ"}}
+---+

  You can use the calendar collection matches, for example, to retain a calendar, including all `calendar.txt`,
`calendar_dates.txt`, and `trip.txt` entries that reference the specified `service_id` value.  This convenient
short-hand is easier than writing the equivalent expression using references to the three file types separately.    

Types of Transforms

* Add an Entity

  Create and add a new entity to the feed.

+---+
{"op":"add","obj":{"file":"agency.txt", "agency_id":"ST", "agency_name":"Sound Transit",
"agency_url":"http://www.soundtransit.org", "agency_timezone":"America/Los_Angeles"}}
+---+

* Update an Entity

  You can update arbitrary fields of a GTFS entity.

+---+
{"op":"update", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"574"}, "update":{"agency_id":"ST"}}
+---+

* Retain an Entity

  We also provide a powerful mechanism for selecting just a sub-set of a feed.  You can apply retain operations to entities you wish to keep and all the supporting entities referenced by the retained entity will be retained as well.  By the same token, unreferenced entities will be pruned.
  
  In the following example, only route B15 will be retained, along with all the stops, trips, stop times, shapes, and agencies linked to directly by that route.

+---+
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"B15"}}
+---+

  By default, we retain across {{{https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#trips_block_id_field}block_id}} values
specified in trips.txt.  That means if a particular trip is retained (perhaps because its parent route is retained),
and the trip specifies a block_id, then all the trips referencing that block_id will be retained as well, along with
their own routes, stop times, and shapes.  This can potentially lead to unexpected results if you retain one route and
suddenly see other routes included because they are linked by block_id.

  You can disable this feature by specifying <<<retainBlocks: false>>> in the JSON transformer snippet.  Here is an
example:

+---+
{"op":"retain","match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"B15"}, "retainBlocks":false}
+---+

* Remove an Entity

  You can remove a specific entity from a feed.

+---+
{"op":"remove", "match":{"file":"stopst.txt", "stop_name":"Stop Name"}}
+---+

  Note that removing an entity has a cascading effect.  If you remove a trip, all the stop times that depend on that
trip will also be removed.  If you remove a route, all the trips and stop times for that route will be removed.
  
* Trim a Trip

  You can remove stop times from the beginning or end of a trip using the "trim_trip" operation.  Example:
  
+---+
{"op":"trim_trip", "match":{"file":"trips.txt", "route_id":"R10"}, "from_stop_id":"138S"}
+---+

  For any trip belonging to the specified route and passing through the specified stop, all stop times from the specified
stop onward will be removed from the trip.  You can also remove stop times from the beginning of the trip as well:

+---+
{"op":"trim_trip", "match":{"file":"trips.txt", "route_id":"R10"}, "to_stop_id":"138S"}
+---+

  Or both:

+---+
{"op":"trim_trip", "match":{"file":"trips.txt", "route_id":"R10"}, "to_stop_id":"125S", "from_stop_id":"138S"}
+---+

* Arbitrary Transform

  We also allow you to specify arbitrary transformations as well.  Here, you specify your transformation class and we will
automatically instantiate it for use in the transform pipeline.

+---+
{"op":"transform", "class":"some.class.implementing.GtfsTranformStrategy"}
+---+

  We additionally provide a mechanism for setting additional properties of the transform.  For all additional properties
specified in the JSON snippet, we will attempt to set that Java bean property value on the instantiated transformation object.
See for example:

+---+
{"op":"transform", "class":"org.onebusaway.gtfs_transformer.updates.ShapeTransformStrategy", "shapeId":"6010031", \
"shape":"wjb~G|abmVpAz]v_@@?wNE_GDaFs@?@dFX`GGjN__@A"}
+--+

  Here, we set additional properties on the `ShapeTransformStrategy`, making it possible to reuse and configure a generic
transformer to your needs.

Additional Examples

* How to reduce your GTFS

  We can apply a modification that retains certain GTFS entities and all other entities required directly or indirectly by
those entities.  For example, create a file with the following contents (call it modifications.txt, as an example):

+---+
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"B15"}}
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"B62"}}
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"B63"}}
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"BX19"}}
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"Q54"}}
{"op":"retain", "match":{"file":"routes.txt", "route_short_name":"S53"}}
+---+

  Then run:

+---+
java -jar onebusaway-gtfs-transformer-cli.jar --transform=modifications.txt source-gtfs.zip target-gtfs.zip
+--+

  The resulting GTFS will have the retained only the routes with the matching short names and all other entities required
to support those routes.
  
* Merge Trips and Refactor Calendar Entries

  Some agencies model their transit schedule favoring multiple entries in
calendar_dates.txt as opposed to a more concise entry in calendar.txt.
A smaller number of agencies take this scheme even further, creating trips.txt
entries for each service date, even when the underlying trips are exactly the
same.  This can cause the size of the GTFS to grow dramatically as trips and
stop times are duplicated.

  We provide a simple transformer that can attempt to detect these duplicate
trips, remove them, and simplify the underlying calendar entries to match.  To
run it, apply the following transform:

+---+
{"op":"transform", "class":"org.onebusaway.gtfs_transformer.updates.CalendarSimplicationStrategy"}
+---+

  The transform optionally takes two additional arguments:
  
  * minNumberOfWeeksForCalendarEntry - how many weeks does a service id need to
    span before it gets its own entry in calendar.txt (default=3)

  * dayOfTheWeekInclusionRatio - if a service id is being modeled with a
    calendar.txt entry, how frequent does a day of the week need to before it's
    modeled positively in calendar.txt with any negative exceptions noted in
    calendar_dates.txt, vs making no entry for that day of the week in
    calendar.txt and instead noting any positive exceptions in
    calendar_dates.txt.  This is useful for filtering out a calendar that is
    always active on Sunday, but has one or two Mondays for a holiday.
    Frequency is defined as how often the target day of the week occurs vs the
    count for day of the week appearing MOST frequently for the service id
    (default=0.5)
